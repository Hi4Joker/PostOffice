 * <p>
 *     This is an experimental UI class for testing out the new Material Design enhancements to the
 *     dialog system introduced in the newest Support Library Release.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 *     Changes, features, and enhancements in this class will probably be rolled over to the Mail
 *     class for the final release, it will probably just be refactored, so this class
 *     is not to be relied upon in production
